Provisioning
============

The included `bootstrap.sh` script is executed by Vagrant during the provisioning process and can be modified to contain any additional configurations that you may want to include or share with collaborators.

Other Provisioners
------------------

There are also plenty of other provisioners that will work with Vagrant, so if bash provisioning isn't enough for your required configuration, check out the [official documentation](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/index.html) for more information.
